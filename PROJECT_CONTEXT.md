# AI Image Converter SaaS - Project Context

## ðŸŽ¯ **Project Overview**

**AI Image Converter** is a SaaS application that uses Google Gemini AI to intelligently convert and resize images for different social media platforms and marketing materials. Users upload a single Figma-designed image and the app automatically converts it into various form factors optimized for multiple platforms.

## ðŸ’¡ **Core Idea**

The application leverages AI to understand image layouts, elements, and visual hierarchy, then intelligently rearranges and resizes these elements for different platforms - just like a human designer would do in Figma. This eliminates the manual work of creating multiple versions of the same design for different social media platforms.
